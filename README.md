# COMMANDING MOBILE ROBOT MOVEMENT USING NLP AND ML
Robotic movement is one of the most important matters of concern in the majority of industries today. Traditionally, Robots need to be given specific set of commands in order to carry out tasks, that have to be constructed via precise patterns and rules to dictate robots to correctly perform actions.

All the currently existing solutions like Voice Recognition Processor(VRP), Microsoft Speech SDK 5.1, etc translate by using word-to-word translation principle, and neither do they take into account the context of the full message, nor do they consider the expandability of the command text. These methodologies are tedious, and highly non-intuitive in nature.

This project work utilizes the potential of Natural Language Processing, and Machine Learning for the task of Human-Machine communication. The main aim of this project work is to propose a system that effectively translates a Natural Language input into a set of robot path trajectory commands, considering both the expandability of command text and context of the full message. The integration of machine learning allows the system to endlessly learn, and adapt to new commands in future.

Hence, the proposed system consists of a pre-processing function, command classification, parameter classification, and post-processing function, thereby utilizing the Neural Machine Translation(NMT) approach by using RNN encoding-decoding for classification purposes. 

We would like to let you know that this project was a part of our B.E. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY curriculum, i.e., this was our Final Year Project. We have attached detailed report with diagrams and explanations, and also output of this project. Please refer REPORT.pdf for the same.
